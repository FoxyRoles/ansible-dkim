## Default Variables for ansible-dkim role

## The "selector" for opendkim keys and DNS records generation
dkim_selector: email

## The e-mail address that manages opendkim
dkim_admin_email: "{{ admin_email | default ( omit ) }}"
# This variable, in the role's namespace `dkim_`, is defined with the value of `admin_email` for backward
# compatibility of the role, and eventually to harmonise this value accross a whole set of roles. 
# In your playbooks, you MUST set either `dkim_admin_email` or `admin_email`

## The list of domains you want opendkim to sign mails for MUST be defined as a list:
# dkim_domains:
#   - domain1.tld
#   - domain2.tld
#   - domain3.tld

## Whether opendkim uses the same key for all domains or one key per domain
dkim_same_key: true
